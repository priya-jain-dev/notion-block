## Why started this app
[Last week](https://www.priya.today/blogs/devtool-design-mode) while learning about `document.designMode` option. I come across `contenteditable` property in HTML which will make any element editable.

So, will try to build on top off that option.

## Building basic notion app functionality

---1. Option to create block---
---2. Add Basic html elements - h1. h2, h3, paragraph---
---3. Giving context menu option---
4. Giving floating menu on word select
5. drag-drop option
